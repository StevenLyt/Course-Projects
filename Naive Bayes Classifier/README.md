# Naive Bayes' Classifier

Implementation of a simple data identifier relying on Bayes’ Theorem. It takes in a collection of data for training and is thus able to determine how likely an object with a specific set of attributes will have a certain classification, such as identifying fruits and analyzing voting patterns.

Compile with `make` and run `./bayes` followed by the file containing training data, the file containing information to be classified, and the output file. It will ignore duplicate attribute in the same line.
